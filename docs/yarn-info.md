# Yarn benefits vs NPM
- **Faster performance**: Yarn is generally faster than NPM when it comes to installing packages. Yarn's caching mechanism allows it to avoid re-downloading packages that have already been installed, making the installation process much faster.


- **Predictable installs**: Yarn uses a deterministic algorithm to install packages, which means that it installs the same package versions across different machines and environments. This makes it easier to ensure that the same code runs the same way on different systems.


- **Better security**: Yarn has built-in security features that help prevent malicious packages from being installed. For example, it uses checksums to verify that packages haven't been tampered with, and it can also validate packages against a list of known vulnerabilities.


- **Improved command-line interface**: Yarn has a more user-friendly command-line interface than NPM, with features like interactive prompts and colored output. This makes it easier to use and understand, especially for developers who are new to package management.
